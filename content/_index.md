In the Fall of 2024, I left the world of professional software development and cybersecurity to become a high school computer science teacher. From lesson plans to lessons learned, this blog not only serves as a record of my journey from Professional Nerd to Professional Nerducator, but also as a resource for others who are considering a similar leap.

Thanks for joining me on this adventure!
