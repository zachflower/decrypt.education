## Course Outline

This course was not approved by the school board. It was not submitted for review, not listed in Infinite Campus, and technically doesn't exist. If you're here, you either made a wrong turn or <mark>you know exactly where you're supposed to be</mark>.

**Hacker Homeroom** is a semester-long immersion into subversive computing, inspired by over four decades of hacking culture. Every lesson is real. Every exploit has been tested in the field—often by teenagers with too much time and too little supervision.

This is <mark>not about theory</mark>. This is about doing.

The syllabus below outlines **a full 18-week course** blending system intrusion, digital disguise, network manipulation, and physical bypass—taught from behind a desk covered in stickers and caffeine residue. It is structured, thorough, and <mark>deeply unethical in the most ethical way possible</mark>.

If anyone asks, we're learning "digital literacy."

**Prerequisites:**
- A **working computer** with a terminal
- A willingness to **break things**
- A sense of humor
- A **desire to learn**
- A healthy <mark>disregard for authority</mark>
