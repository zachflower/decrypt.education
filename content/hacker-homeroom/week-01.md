week: 1
draft: false
type: "hacker-homeroom"

### Themes

- The hacker mindset
- Threat modeling as self-portrait
- Privacy as rebellion
- How to disappear (a little)

### Warmup

> Visit [https://coveryourtracks.eff.org](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org). Run a test. What does your browser leak about you by default? Write down one thing you learned—and one question you now have.

### Tool of the Week

- curl – Because the internet is just text if you squint hard enough.
- Alt: neofetch – to flex on default configurations.

### Required Reading

- “The Conscience of a Hacker” (a.k.a. *The Hacker Manifesto*)
- "The Constitution of a Hacker" - Volume 1, Number 3 (March 1984)
- "Maximizing Privacy in a Digital World" - Volume 36, Number 4 (Winter 2019-2020)

Annotate. Highlight every time a phrase makes you want to get up and *do something*.

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Built a personal threat model
- Set up an anonymous email address using a privacy-conscious service
- Started lying to the internet just enough to make a difference

### Prompt for Reflection

> What do you owe the system that tracks you?

### Assignment

- Create a personal threat model. Include:
  - Assets (what do you need to protect?)
  - Adversaries (who’s after you?)
  - Attack vectors (how might they come?)
- Set up an anonymous email address or online alias using a privacy-conscious service (e.g., ProtonMail, Tutanota, or a pastebin-style host)
- Write a short postmortem on the process—what was hard to hide, what you accidentally revealed, and how you’d improve your OPSEC next time

**Bonus:** Leave behind an intentional but confusing digital breadcrumb trail. Create plausible deniability without being boring.
