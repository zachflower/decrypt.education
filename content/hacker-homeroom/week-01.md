This opening week **sets the tone**: curiosity, defiance, and a quiet refusal to accept digital life at face value. You will be introduced to the hacker not as a criminal or a joke, but as a questioner, a builder, a breaker—someone who asks <mark>"why not?" when told "that’s just how it is."</mark>

**More than just a boot-up** into the semester, this first lesson asks you to <mark>reflect on who you are</mark>, what data you leak by default, and what it might mean to take control of your digital identity. In a world where surveillance is ambient, anonymity is resistance—and **resistance starts with awareness**.

We begin by unpacking **what a hacker is**, why hackers do what they do, and how to recognize the subtle edges of system control that most people miss. <mark>It's not about tools yet—it's about perspective</mark>. This is not a fantasy of rebellion. It's an invitation to rewire the way you see everything.

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Built a **personal threat model**
- Set up an **anonymous email address** using a privacy-conscious service
- Started **lying to the internet** just enough to make a difference

**Themes**:
- The hacker mindset
- Threat modeling as self-portrait
- Privacy as rebellion
- How to disappear <mark>(a little)</mark>

### POST

Visit [https://coveryourtracks.eff.org](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org) and run a test.

What does your browser leak about you by default?

<mark>Write down one thing you learned—and one question you now have.</mark>

---

### Utility Spotlight

[curl](https://curl.se/) – Because <mark>the internet is just text</mark> if you squint hard enough.

> Curl is a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. It’s like a Swiss Army knife for the web, allowing you to send and receive data in various formats. You’ll use it to test APIs, download files, and even scrape web pages.

### Readings

- The Mentor, [The Conscience of a Hacker](https://phrack.org/issues/7/3) (January 1986)
- "The Constitution of a Hacker" - Volume 1, Number 3 (March 1984)
- "Maximizing Privacy in a Digital World" - Volume 36, Number 4 (Winter 2019-2020)

Annotate it all. Highlight every time a phrase makes you want to <mark>get up and *do something*</mark>.

### TODO

Your first assignment is to <mark>start lying to the internet</mark>. This is not a test of your technical skills, but a test of your willingness to question the status quo:

1. **Create a [personal threat model](https://ssd.eff.org/module/your-security-plan)** for yourself—this is a self-portrait of your digital life, and it should include:
    - Assets (what do you need to protect?)
    - Adversaries (who’s after you?)
    - Attack vectors (how might they come?)
2. **Set up an anonymous email address** or online alias using a privacy-conscious service (e.g., [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com), [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com), etc.), and use it to sign up for a service you normally use. This is your first step toward digital anonymity.
3. **Write a short postmortem** on your experience. Answer questions like:
    - What was easy?
    - What was hard?
    - What did you learn about yourself in the process?
    - How does it feel to lie to the internet?

**BONUS:** Leave behind an intentional but confusing digital breadcrumb trail. Create plausible deniability without being boring.

### Reflect

> What do you owe the system that tracks you?
