- A phone and a plausible voice
- Alt: Canva or Google Docs (for forging realistic visual artifacts)

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- Social engineering
- Pretexting
- Human-layer exploits

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Designed a plausible pretext to gain access to a restricted system or space
- Identified common failure points in human-based security
- Evaluated ethical boundaries around manipulation

### Prompt for Reflection

> When does a lie become a breach?

### Assignment

- Create a fictional social engineering scenario targeting a common institution (e.g., school office, help desk, IT department)
- Design a script, flowchart, or decision tree outlining how your attack would proceed
- Identify potential red flags and defenses the target might use
- Write a 1-page reflection on the ethical line between influence and harm

**Bonus:** Create a physical artifact (e.g., fake badge, forged letterhead, mock support ticket) to support your pretext.
