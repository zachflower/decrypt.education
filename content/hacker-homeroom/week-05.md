### Themes

- Phishing and payloads
- Physical attack surfaces
- Trust by design

### Warmup

> Visit [https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/) or [https://www.qrstuff.com/](https://www.qrstuff.com/). Make a QR code that links to something weird. Scan it with your phone. Did you trust it?

### Tool of the Week

- qrencode – Command-line QR generator for Linux
- Alt: QRCode Monkey – slick and full-featured for experiments

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- QR code manipulation
- Physical-world phishing
- USB dead drops and data handoffs

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Created a QR code that links to a prank or decoy destination
- Embedded it in a flyer, sticker, or prop
- Observed how (and if) people interact with it

### Prompt for Reflection

> If a sticker can deliver a payload, where’s the perimeter?

### Assignment

- Design a phishing-style QR payload and embed it in a real-world object
- Monitor engagement (if safe and appropriate)
- Document your design process, intended deception, and results

**Bonus:** Add a tracking parameter or IP logger to your QR link and write about what data you collected—and how easily it could have been more invasive.
