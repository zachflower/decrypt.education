### Themes

- Covert communication
- Steganography and metadata
- The physical delivery layer of hacking

### Warmup

> Visit [https://futureboy.us/stegano/](https://futureboy.us/stegano/). Encode a message into an image. Try decoding it again. Was it what you expected?

### Tool of the Week

- steghide – command-line steganography for embedding secrets
- Alt: online base64 converters or metadata scrubbers

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- Steganography in practice
- Covert data exchange
- Public digital drop points

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Embedded a secret message or file inside another using steganography
- Created or used a covert “dead drop” to pass data to a classmate
- Retrieved and decoded a message without detection

### Prompt for Reflection

> What’s more secure: encryption you can see, or a message you don’t even know exists?

### Assignment

- Encode a file or message inside an innocuous image or document
- Exchange it with a classmate using a shared drive, USB stick, or other subtle handoff
- Decode their message and verify its integrity
- Document your process, including what made your drop convincing (or suspicious)

**Bonus:** Chain multiple encoding or delivery methods together. Try to make your handoff impossible to detect without inside knowledge.
