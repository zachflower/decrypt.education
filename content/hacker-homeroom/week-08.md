### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Picked a basic pin tumbler lock
- Identified weaknesses in common locks or containers
- Explored at least one tool-free bypass method

### Prompt for Reflection

> If you’ve never picked a lock before, why does it feel so wrong—and so right?

### Assignment

- Practice picking a transparent or low-security lock
- Research and test a bypass technique (e.g., shimming, bumping, jiggling)
- Document your method, tools used, and whether you succeeded

**Bonus:** Write a memo to your school’s facilities team recommending better physical security… without revealing what you did.
