### Tool of the Week

- privacybadger, uBlock Origin, or LibreWolf
- Alt: curl with verbose headers to watch your browser talk back

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- Surveillance avoidance
- Obfuscation tactics
- Browser/device fingerprinting

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Assessed and modified your browser’s fingerprint
- Examined system-level telemetry on your device
- Identified at least one method to limit digital tracking

### Prompt for Reflection

> Are you paranoid enough to be realistic?

### Assignment

- Document what information your browser leaks by default
- Apply at least three fingerprinting countermeasures
- Compare your fingerprint before and after
- Reflect on whether true anonymity is feasible

**Bonus:** Set up a “burner” browser profile that launches with randomized or spoofed metadata each time
