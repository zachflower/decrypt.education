### Themes

- Automation for exploitation
- Script chaining and triggers
- Toolsmithing and task simplification

### Warmup

> Visit [https://cron.help](https://cron.help) or open your system’s Task Scheduler. Can you build a chain of tasks that launch each other in sequence? Try it.

### Tool of the Week

- bash, PowerShell, or Python scripting
- Alt: Zapier, AutoHotKey, or Automator for GUI-driven mischief

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- Automation in penetration testing
- Scripting for recon, escalation, or exfiltration
- Chainable and repeatable exploits

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Built a script or tool that automates a previously manual hack
- Chained multiple commands into a single execution path
- Demonstrated the result in a controlled setting

### Prompt for Reflection

> Is it still hacking if you don’t touch the keyboard?

### Assignment

- Create a script that automates one technique from a prior week
- Document its purpose, limitations, and ethical use cases
- Bonus if it runs at login, boot, or on a trigger

**Bonus:** Publish your script with full documentation and an ironic README as if it were a totally legitimate utility
