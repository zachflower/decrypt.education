### Themes

- Exploit development fundamentals
- Privilege escalation
- Vulnerabilities and bad assumptions

### Warmup

> Visit [https://exploit.education](https://exploit.education). Try the first challenge in “Protostar.” What are you being asked to break—and why?

### Tool of the Week

- gdb or pwndbg – for binary analysis
- Alt: Python fuzzers or payload generators (e.g., msfvenom)

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- Buffer overflows
- Exploit writing
- Local privilege escalation

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Discovered or replicated a known vulnerability in a sandboxed system
- Written or modified a simple exploit to gain elevated privileges
- Reflected on the ethical line between curiosity and misuse

### Prompt for Reflection

> If you know how to break something but don’t fix it—or tell anyone—did you still help?

### Assignment

- Reproduce a basic local exploit from a known CVE or training platform
- Document what caused the flaw, how it was exploited, and how it could be patched
- Include screenshots, code, and mitigation strategies

**Bonus:** Attempt to generalize your exploit for variations in system config or version—and explain why it might or might not work
