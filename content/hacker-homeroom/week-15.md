### Themes

- Personalization of tools
- Repeatable workflows
- Operational efficiency

### Warmup

> Visit [https://github.com/topics/hacking-tools](https://github.com/topics/hacking-tools). Browse for 5 minutes. What’s one tool you’d actually use? One that feels completely unnecessary?

### Tool of the Week

- alias, .bashrc, functions.sh, etc.
- Alt: GitHub repos, script collections, or dotfile starters

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- Custom tool development
- Script collections
- Hacker efficiency and workflow

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Created a personal “toolkit” folder with useful scripts or configs
- Built at least one utility that automates or improves a common task
- Documented each tool with a short usage guide

### Prompt for Reflection

> If someone used your toolkit, what would they learn about you?

### Assignment

- Organize your hacker toolkit into a clearly labeled directory or repo
- Include scripts, aliases, or configs developed this semester
- Annotate each one with what it does and why it’s useful

**Bonus:** Make a zine-style README that explains your toolkit’s philosophy, priorities, and aesthetic
