title: "Week 16: Wi-Fi Is a Lie"
week: 16
draft: false
type: "hacker-homeroom"

### Themes

- Wireless trust assumptions
- Packet sniffing and monitor mode
- Evil twins and rogue APs

### Warmup

> Visit [https://wigle.net](https://wigle.net). Zoom in on your area. How many access points are visible? How many are named like someone's home router?

### Tool of the Week

- airmon-ng, airodump-ng, aireplay-ng (Aircrack suite)
- Alt: Kismet or Wireshark in monitor mode

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- Wi-Fi packet analysis
- WEP/WPA cracking
- Rogue access points and network impersonation

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Captured wireless traffic from an open or test network
- Identified devices, SSIDs, and handshake attempts
- Created a fake AP (in a controlled lab) and tested responses

### Prompt for Reflection

> If a network has bars, does that mean it's safe?

### Assignment

- Use Aircrack tools to capture and analyze wireless traffic
- Simulate a deauth attack or evil twin setup in an isolated lab
- Document what was seen, what worked, and how detection might occur

**Bonus:** Build a portable rogue AP in a tin using a Raspberry Pi and write a field deployment guide
