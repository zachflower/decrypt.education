### Themes

- Encryption vs. obfuscation
- Steganography redux
- Ephemeral tools and operational secrecy

### Warmup

> Visit [https://keybase.io](https://keybase.io) or [https://proton.me](https://proton.me). Create a public key or explore secure messaging. What’s the UX tradeoff for strong encryption?

### Tool of the Week

- gpg – for encrypted files and identity verification
- Alt: Signal, ProtonMail, or a steganographic image tool of your choice

### Required Reading

Search the 2600 archives for articles related to:
- PGP/GPG usage
- Encrypted messaging
- Privacy in hostile environments

### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Created a PGP keypair and encrypted/decrypted test messages
- Embedded a message in an image or file using steganography
- Evaluated secure tools based on threat model and usability

### Prompt for Reflection

> When you secure your communications, who do you think you’re protecting them from?

### Assignment

- Create and exchange encrypted messages with a classmate using GPG or a secure messaging platform
- Encode a short secret into an image or audio file
- Compare the security and convenience of both approaches in a written reflection

**Bonus:** Develop a multi-layered message (stego + encrypted + password-protected archive) and explain how you’d communicate the key in a secure but subtle way
