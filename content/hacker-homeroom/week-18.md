### Hands-On Objective

By the end of this week, you will have:

- Built a final project that showcases multiple concepts from the semester
- Written a detailed project report, walkthrough, or writeup
- Presented your work to peers for feedback and awe

### Prompt for Reflection

> When you look at what you built, what does it say about what you believe?

### Assignment

- Create and submit a final project that demonstrates applied knowledge from at least three different weeks
- Write a technical report or zine-style guide explaining the why, how, and impact
- Present your work to the class with a focus on clarity, creativity, and operational ethics

**Bonus:** Include an Easter egg or puzzle in your documentation that only a fellow hacker would find
