... because my AI workflow don't stop!

I'm so sorry. I'm already ashamed of that titleâ€”but I'm going to leave it there as a testament to my hubris.

When it comes to AI in the classroom, there are a ton of hot-takes (many from people who have never actually _used_ AI in the classroom). I have a ton of thoughts on the subject, but I think I'll save those for another couple dozen posts. Instead, for _this_ post, I wanted to talk about what my AI-driven workflow looks like as a brand new teacher.

**Fun Fact:** Teachers have astonishingly little time for things like grading, lesson planning, and professional development. While I knew going in that the balance between teaching and _everything else_ would be a challenge, I made the mistake of thinking that I'd have _some_ time to work on other things during the day.

I was wrong.

So, in order to keep my head above water, I've had to get creative with how I use my time.

Enter: AI

## Lesson Planning

## Grading and Assessment

## Professional Development
