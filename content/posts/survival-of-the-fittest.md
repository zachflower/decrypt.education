I've never been much of a napper.

I don't know if it's because I'm a generally deep sleeper, or have too much of an overactive mind, or if it's just training from a lifetime of obsession with computer-y things, but napping has never been a skill of mine.

That is, **until I started teaching**.

Holy hell, career teachers have a lot of stamina. I mean... I knew going in that things were going to be different for me, but what I didn't expect was the impact the role would have on my body. I'm not just talking about the mental exhaustion that comes from direct instruction, lesson planning, and grading, but also the physical toll that comes from being on my feet all day, every day.

My first two weeks as a teacher were **rough**.

I was so worn out when I got home every day at 4:30 that I would **immediately** collapse onto the couch in a heap and fall asleep. I'd wake up an hour later to find my kids burning the house down without any adult supervision, have a quick dinner, and then go to bed at 8:00, only to wake up the next morning and do it all over again.

I'm a few months in now, and I've come to the conclusion that **teaching is an endurance sport**, and winning means taking care of myself in ways that I never really bothered to do before. Eating right, exercising, and getting enough sleep are all things that I've always known are important, but now they're non-negotiable.

I've got a real bedtime now, I'm eating more fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and have been cutting back on the caffeine and sugar that I used to rely on to get through the day. Hell, I've even started swimming again... at 5:00 in the morning... before school... because I know that if I don't, I won't make it to summer.

Here's the thing though... as exhausting as teaching is, it's **nothing** compared to the anxiety-ridden grind of my previous career. I'm working harder than I ever have before, but for the first time in over a decade I don't have any back pain, I'm not constantly stressed to the point of physical illness, and I'm sleeping better than I have in years.

I'm not saying that teaching is easy (it's the opposite, actually), but I am saying that it's a **different kind of hard**. And for me, it's a trade-off that has been worth every bit of effort.
